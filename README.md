# Small Simple Pokedex
## About The Project
The core reason why this web applet was developed was to enable myself to learn about API and asynchronous execution. What was initialy a simple web app where the user could enter the name or Id of a pokemon and see its stats slowly balloned. After two restarts the project became a tool for me to also learn how to interact and manipulate large JSON files; use webpack, reduce and simplify my CSS workflow with scss, use local storage API and create a compelling and intuitive user experience.  

### Features
The web application has a multiple features which include.
- Run on the same webpage.
- Searching for pokekon by name or my moves they can use.
- Filtering said serch results by :
	- Pokemon Types
	- Move Types that can be learned

	- Egg Group
	- Generation they appear in
- Adding the  pokemon to a liked list to be viewed later
- Viewing stats of the individual pokemon
- Selectiong two pokemon to compaer
